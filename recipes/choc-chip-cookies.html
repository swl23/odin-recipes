        These cookies are rooted in classic Toll House flavor, but browning the butter amps up the toasty notes and is key in developing the balance of crisp edges, while a high ratio of brown sugar to white sugar ensures chewy chocolate chip cookie centers. The amount of flour and the quality of the pure vanilla extract is important here; Chris recommends Heilala or Nielsen-Massey, which have enough heft to stand up to bitter dark chocolate. We highly recommend weighing your flour with a scale; if you don't have one, use a spoon to scoop the flour into a measuring cup until overflowing, and a straight edge (such as the back of a butter knife) to level it off.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 g kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 g baking soda</li>
        <li>169 g unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>175 g dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>43.75 g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>170 g bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped, or semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350Â°. Whisk 200 g all-purpose flour, 4 g kosher salt, and 4 g baking soda in a small bowl; set flour mixture aside.</li>
        <li>Cook 113 g (1 stick) unsalted butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, swirling often and scraping bottom of pan with a heatproof rubber spatula, until butter foams, then browns, about 4 minutes. Scrape melted butter and any brown bits to a large heatproof mixing bowl and let cool 1 minute. Cut remaining 56 g (1/2 stick) unsalted butter into small pieces and add to brown butter (it should start to melt but not foam and sizzle, so test with one piece before adding the rest).</li>
        <li>Once butter is melted, add 175 g dark brown sugar and 43.75 g granulated sugar and whisk, breaking up any clumps, until sugar is incorporated and no lumps remain. Add 1 large egg and 2 large egg yolks and whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds. Whisk in 2 tsp. vanilla extract. Using rubber spatula, fold reserved dry ingredients into butter mixture just until no dry spots remain, then fold in 170 g bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped, or semisweet chocolate chips. Put the cookie batter in the fridge or freezer and let chill until hard.</li>
        <li>Portion out 1.65 oz balls of dough and divide between 2 parchment-paper-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake cookies, rotating sheets if cookies are browning very unevenly (otherwise, just leave them alone), until deep golden brown and firm around the edges, 8-10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets.</li>
    </ol>
